## ◻️ Context

> The company confront the challenge of stock and querying real-time geolocation data, continuously generated by IoT devices such as wearables, tags, and smartphones. This data is essential for monitoring people and assets, requiring a system that can manage large volumes of information in a scalable, dependable, and secure way.
>
> To defeat these obstacles, we propose developing a solution that automates the management and configuration of geolocation data. This solution will allow the company to speed up the deployment of the operations, ensuring the integrity, consistency, and security of the information, while reducing the need for specialized technicians' intervention. As a result, the company will optimize real-time monitoring and tracking, making the operations more agile and efficient.
